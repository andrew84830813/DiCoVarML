\usage{
dcvRatioFilter(
  xtrain,
  ytrain,
  xtest = NULL,
  impute_factor = 1e-07,
  nfold_dcv = 1,
  th_percent = 0.5,
  useKFN = T,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{xtrain}{A samples(n) by log ratios(p) matrix to be used for feature selection}

\item{ytrain}{Class labels vector of length n}

\item{xtest}{A samples (xn)by log ratios (xp) matrix to subset after features are discovered on the xtrain matrix.}

\item{impute_factor}{multiplicative factor for imputed zero counts/abundance}

\item{nfold_dcv}{number of cross validation folds for DCV computation. Default is 1(all data). Increasing folds increases computational time exponentially.}

\item{th_percent}{dcv score percentile for thresholding i.e. keep ratio where dcvScore > threshold(th_percent)}

\item{useKFN}{should a k-farthest neighbor graph be used to further sparsify log ratios for dense network}

\item{k}{the number of farthest neighbors (most differential nodes/parts/taxa etc. between group via DCV score) for KFN graph}
}
\value{
A list containing:\tabular{ll}{
   \code{MST} \tab a n x f (retained log ratios) derived from MST  \cr
   \tab \cr
   \code{Dense} \tab a n x f (retained log ratios)  derived from dense thresholding \cr
   \tab \cr
   }
}
\description{
Selects 2 subset of log ratios based dcvScore thresholding. Theses subset are:
\itemize{
 \item{"MST-set"}{ - Non Redundant Subset of logratios pruned after thresholding}
 \item{"Dense"}{ - All log ratios after thresholding }
}
}
