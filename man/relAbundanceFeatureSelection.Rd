relAbundanceFeatureSelection(
  train_data,
  y_train,
  test_data,
  impute_zeroes = T,
  featureSelectionMethod = 1,
  impute_factor,
  num_borutaRuns = 100,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{train_data}{a samples by log ratio matrix for feature discovery on training data}

\item{y_train}{training set class labels}

\item{test_data}{a samples by log ratio matrix to subset and return. Note key log-ratios are discovered using training set.}

\item{impute_zeroes}{should zeroes be imputed}

\item{featureSelectionMethod}{1 - Boruta; 2- LASSO ; 3 - None}

\item{impute_factor}{impute factor multiplicative replacement of zeroes}

\item{num_borutaRuns}{number of runs of the boruta algorithm}

\item{glm_family}{which family to use for logistics regression. Should be a valid glmnet family. default = 'binomial'}

\item{glm_alpha}{glmnet alpha parameter (0,1] where 1-LASSO and (0,1) - elasticnet}
}
\value{
A list containing:\tabular{ll}{
   \code{train_Data} \tab samples by features (derived from featureSelectionMethod) training data  \cr
   \tab \cr
   \code{test_data} \tab samples by features (derived from featureSelectionMethod) test data \cr

\description{
*Not recommended.* Carries out Boruta feature selection on raw count of relative abundance data.
